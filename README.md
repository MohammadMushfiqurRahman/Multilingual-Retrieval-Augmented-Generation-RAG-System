# Multilingual-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-System
This Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system processes a PDF document to answer English and Bengali queries. It extracts, cleans, and chunks text, then uses a multilingual embedding model and ChromaDB for efficient retrieval, finally generating answers with a question-answering language model.
